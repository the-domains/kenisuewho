# Welcome to the Danger Zone

"In the beginning, there was nothing. And then, there was CHAOS." 

That quote is from a Readers Theater skit that I narrated. We received a [Superior][0] at the South Dakota State Oral Interpretation competition, which validated my belief that I can get away with wearing all black. 

That experience also taught me to fully embrace the role of narrator, often sifting through the chaos of the everyday. 

Without chaos, big or small, life isn't very interesting. The work we do isn't interesting. The emotions we feel aren't interesting. I could wax on and on about how chaos makes things interesting, but I'll save that for my future TED talk. 

What I will talk about is how chaos added a ton of value to my life and made me feel like a total badass. I'll also talk about how chaos can sometimes really suck and will make you feel like you are falling into a big, black hole of nothingness.
